        I often feel myself upset cause of thoughts that people don't like me<br>
    so this song is smth that reminds me to love myself the way i am<3<br>
        <p id="song">I'm the one, two, and three, kissing the mirror, I'm she<br>
Struck like lightning, so ignited<br>
You can hate me for me, baby, that's your loss<br>
Don't love me for somebody I'm not</p>
